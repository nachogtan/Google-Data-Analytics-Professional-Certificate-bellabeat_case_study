## Scenario
In this case, I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of women's health-focused products.
Bellabeat is a successful small, but high-tech, company that makes smart health-focused products. With their products they intend to become a more larger player in the
global market for smart devices.
Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with
knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly
positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available
through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company
has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital
marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and
consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google
Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

To answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the
data analysis process proposed by Google: <b>ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.</b>
