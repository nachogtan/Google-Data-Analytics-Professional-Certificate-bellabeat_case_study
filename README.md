## Scenario
In this case, I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at <b>Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of women's health-focused products</b>.
Bellabeat is a successful small, but high-tech, company that makes smart health-focused products. With their products they intend to become a more larger player in the
global market for smart devices.
Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with
knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly
positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available
through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company
has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital
marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and
consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google
Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

To answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the
data analysis process proposed by Google: <b>ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.</b>

## Ask
This first step focuses on having a clear understanding of the business task and key stakeholders.
We ask ourselves questions?. What we are trying to understand?. How we can use available information to make informed business decisions?.

<b>Business task and key stakeholders:</b>
* <b>Urška Sršen</b>: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer.
* <b>Sando Mur</b>: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team.
* <b>Bellabeat marketing analytics team</b>: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices. To do that she encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits and then apply those findings in one bellabeat product in particular.

## Prepare
The Prepare step is where we analyze the data we're working with? How is it organized? Where does it come from? Is it reliable?, etc.
The Kaggle dataset, [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), is found under de license (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic). 
<br>This dataset consists of 18 csv files and is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03/12/2016 and 05/12/2016. Thirty-three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

The ideal data source should be <b>ROCCC</b>, which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited. In this particular case:
* It is <b>not Reliable</b>, because the sample size is small and it is not representative of the population.
* It is <b>not Original</b> because it is provided by a third party. In this case Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* It <b>is fairly Comprehensive</b> because it includes the right information and parameters to understand smart watch users. 
* It <b>is not Current</b>. The survey ranges from 03/12/2016 to 05/12/2016, which makes it out of date.
* It's <b>not well Cited</b>. Missing key information about data providers, how they do the survey, etc.

Sršen have told us that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages us to consider adding another data to help
address those limitations as we begin to work more with this data.

## Process
This step focuses on formatting, cleaning, and preparing the data for proper analysis. We try to reduce data redundancy to minimize future analytic errors and ensure integrity.
* The tools chosen for this case are "Microsoft SQL Server", "Excel" and "Tableau".
* Data has been sorted, filtered, and formated for analysis. I have focus on remove, duplicates and unnecesary information, check data types, remove outliers, find and fix structurals errors, handle missing data, and data validation.

### <b>1.</b> First of all, we create a new database and import all the files into SQL Server.

### <b>2.</b> We do a quick SELECT statement to inspect tables.

`
SELECT *
FROM dailyActivity_merged
`

`sp_help dailyActivity_merged`

### <b>3.</b> We make a copy of the original table and start reasigning datatypes.

`SELECT * INTO dailyActivity_merged_cpy FROM dailyActivity_merged`

`ALTER TABLE dailyActivity_merged_cpy ALTER COLUMN ActivityDate date`
`ALTER TABLE dailyActivity_merged_cpy ALTER COLUMN TotalSteps int`

All the columns have been converted and the final result is as follows...

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98779367/168878509-f52a1b4a-b235-49ad-bd3c-aa9ac3445d8f.jpg" width="650" height="300">

Note that the LoggedActivitiesDistance and SedentaryActiveDistance columns were removed because they contained most values set to <b>0</b>.

`ALTER TABLE dailyActivity_merged_cpy DROP COLUMN LoggedActivitiesDistance --908 0f 904 rows had values = 0`

`ALTER TABLE dailyActivity_merged_cpy DROP COLUMN SedentaryActiveDistance --858 of 904 rows had values = 0`

TotalDistance and TrackerDistance are <b>duplicate columns</b> so I droped one.

`ALTER TABLE dailyActivity_merged_cpy DROP COLUMN TrackerDistance`

### <b>4.</b> I used DISTINCT to count unique ID's.

`SELECT DISTINCT(id)
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy`

### <b>5.</b> Chek for missing data or blanks.

`SELECT ActivityDate
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy
WHERE ActivityDate IS NULL or ActivityDate = ''`

### <b>6.</b> Create a new column to store weekday.

`ALTER TABLE dailyActivity_merged_cpy ADD Day_of_week varchar(20)`

`UPDATE dailyActivity_merged_cpy
SET Day_of_week = DATENAME(weekday, ActivityDate)
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy`


So far, the data has been formatted and prepared for further analysis. As a result we got a table with <b>13 columns and 940 rows</b>. 
<br>Sorting and filtering has shown us that the <b>unique IDs are 33</b> instead of 30 as stated in the data source.


## Analyze
In this step, we use some SQL functions that help us determine key information about smartwatch users.

The MIN() and MAX() functions will help us explore data and better understand ranges.

`SELECT COUNT(TotalSteps)
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy
WHERE TotalSteps < 100
`

<br>-<b>Check for outliers</b>.

`SELECT COUNT(TotalSteps)
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy
WHERE TotalSteps > 15000`

`SELECT COUNT(TotalSteps)
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy
WHERE TotalSteps BETWEEN 0 AND 15000`

We use AVG() to determine average, steps, calories, distance, active-minutes, seddentary-minutes, etc...

-<b>Looking for empty or NULLS.</b>

`SELECT AVG(TotalSteps) AS avg_steps
FROM dailyActivity_merged_cpy
WHERE Day_of_week = ''`

## Share
Analysis has shown us that:
<br>-Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the days when most users track their activity, the rest of the week shows a decrease in activity, including weekends.

-<b>81% of registered activity corresponds to Sedentary</b>.
<br>-LightlyActiveMinutes represents a 16%, followed by a 2% VeryActiveMInutes and only 1% of FairlyActiveMinutes.

-On average, users recorded <b>7637 steps or 5.4 km</b>.
<br>-Average Calories was <b>2303</b>.
<br>-A <b>correlation as been found between calories burned and the number of steps taken</b>.

-Again, we can see the correlation between steps taken and calories burned.
<br>The hot zones of the scaterplot shows that <b>most activity happens between the range of 0 and 15000 steps</b>.
<br>-Some outliers have been found that are clearily visible in our graph.

-The <b>highest peaks in calories burned occur between 12 noon and 7 p.m</b>.

### Conclusions: 
The unreliability of this data set calls for caution. All of these conclusions need to be double-checked and confirmed with further analysis of a more complete and reliable data set.

* <b>We have learned that the highest peaks of activity occur between Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, beginning to decrease the rest of the week and on weekends.</b>
* <b>There is a clear correlation between calories burned and steps taken.</b>
* <b>Sedentary represents 81% of the total minutes recorded.</b>
* <b>Highest peaks in calories burned occur between 12 noon and 7 p.m.</b>
* <b>In general, the data set is not reliable. It does not provide us with crucial information to understand user habits, such as age or weight. Without this information, we can't be sure what proportion use smartwatches to track vital signs on a daily basis, or which ones uses to plan a physical activity like sports.
Focusing on collecting reliable and clear data will be crucial to obtaining objective information from customers.</b>

### My recommendations:
I would choose to apply this insights to the "Time" product. Because is one of the most used wearables, is easy to collect more information to undertand useres needs. 

<b>1. Focus on creating a reliable database through the Bellabeat app. Since Bellabeat products are heavily focused on women, it would be better to know about the bellabeat app itself. Other smartwatch manufacturers may collect user information that is not necessarily focused on bellabeat's target customers.

<br><b>2. We learned from the data that many users lead sedentary lives. In the data we learned that the activity decreases towards the weekends, so it would be good to encourage customers about the importance of a well-distributed activity throughout the week.

<br><b>3. Keeping a good track of vital signs would be very important. Know blood pressure, oxygen concentration, pulse, etc. it is really important to understand users needs and give them an even more personalized experience.
